# Low-level Programming

This is the module of Low-level Programming, created during Full Stack Software Engineering program at Holberton School, this module aims to understand how programming languages and Unix system work, basically **what is going on under the hood**, whit a strong focus in developing algorithms.

## Technologies:

- **C Programming** C90 Standard
- **Bash scripts**
- Tested on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**
- Compiler **gcc 4.8.4**
